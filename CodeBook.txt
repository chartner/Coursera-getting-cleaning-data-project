The script run_analysis.R performs the steps described in the readme file.

    1. the raw data is assigned a name and read into the R script.  
    2. the data is combined by variable
    3. the desired data (mean/std) are extracted
    4. columns are named/labeled according to their value, ie. subject, activity, ID
    5. all the data is combined into one data frame
    6. data abbreviations are expanded to enhance readability and understanding
    7. the averages (means) of the data columns are taken and a new tidy data table is created, "averages_data.txt".



Variables

subject_train/test, y_train/test, x_train/test contain the data from the downloaded files.
subject, activitydata, featuresdata combine the previous datasets to further analysis.
features contains the correct names for the featuresdata dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in getmeanstd, a numeric vector used to extract the desired data.
A similar approach is taken with activity names through the activitity labels variable.
totaldata combines the previous datasets into one dataset.
Finally, averages_data contains the relevant averages which will be later stored in a .txt file. ddply() from the plyr package is used to apply colMeans() and ease the development.
